set environment variable CUPTI_SAMPLING_PERIOD to a value from 
  1 (minimum sampling period --> fastest sampling) to 5 (maximum sampling period --> slowest sampling)
setting to a value outside this range will disable CUPTI.

Example usage:

CUPTI_DEVICE_NUM=0 CUPTI_SAMPLING_PERIOD=5 /path/to/timesampling <application name>
